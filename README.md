# Document-Classification-

This repo comprises the python script to classifiy unstructured data (documents). The data is converted into a numeric vectors using tf-idf. Four types of supervised machine learning algirhtms were applied to classify the documents, namely Linear Support Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The script was also inteded to perform oversampling prior to fitting the models as the classes of the data were not balanced.
